### Origin
This extension has special a place in my heart - it's the very first one I've built!  
It was all the way back in 2016, while visiting my parents in my hometown.  
At that time, I was using "Grab and Drag" addon for Firefox, and I've learned that upcoming Firefox 57 will not support these old addons.  
And when I found that addons are actually build using HTML/CSS/JavaScript - technologies I've already knew very well, I've decided to create a replacement! And soon after, Group Speed Dial was born as well...
